## Functions, Nested loops
Project done in **ALX Software Engineering school**. it aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nestedi
loops in **C Language**.

#Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc
* C files are tested on Ubuntu 20.04LTS
* Editor allowed was vi, vim, emacs. (vi used)
